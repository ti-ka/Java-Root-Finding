		 Assignment:
		 
		 1.	Write a program that will find the value of e^x to within 0.00001.  Your program should:
			a.	Ask the user for the value of x.  x should be able to be positive or negative.
			b.	Hints â€“ you can try it in a program like excel first if you want.
			c.	Your program should use a loop with a condition in it comparing the current value to the previous value.  If the difference between those two numbers is = to or less than 0.00001, stop the loop.  
			d. 	Make sure and record how many iterations it takes.
